Go to [[http://adventofcode.com][adventofcode.com]] and sign up with your GitHub account.
You'll be given a list of puzzles, one for each day of December until Christmas.
Each puzzle is two parts that build on a theme.
Solve the first part to get access to the second.
The puzzles are self-contained and are not related to each other despite through some great story telling.
Solving a puzzle means computing some small output given your input.
The input is personalized to your account.

** 🗂️ Data
You can either copy-paste the input from the website or use the [[download_input]] script.
This depends on the [[https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data][aocd]] utility.
The download script will respect the following layout.

The data is stored in the [[data]] directory and organized by year and day.

For each day there should at least an [[data/2021/day01/day01_input_puzzle.txt][input file]] =day<day>_input_puzzle.txt=.

Test related inputs and expected results can be stored as well
    - [[data/2021/day01/day01_input_test_1.txt][test input file]] =day<day>_input_test_<test_number>.txt=.
    - [[data/2021/day01/day01a_result_test_1.txt][part test result file]] =day<day><part>_result_test_<test_number>.txt=.

This cumbersome naming allows me to easily search for the data file I am interested in when debugging.
