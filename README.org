** Getting started
Go to [[http://adventofcode.com][adventofcode.com]] and sign up with your GitHub account.
You'll be given a list of puzzles, one for each day of December until Christmas.
Each puzzle is two parts that build on a theme.
Solve the first part to get access to the second.
The puzzles are self-contained and are not related to each other despite through some great story telling.
Solving a puzzle means computing some small output given your input.
The input is personalized to your account.

*** Getting the data
You can either copy-paste the input from the website or use the [[download_input]] script.
This depends on the [[https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data][aocd]] utility.
